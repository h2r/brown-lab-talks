The past few years have seen remarkable advancements in AI. What began with the NLP revolution has sparked new ideas across many fields, including robotics, driving the search for a "RobotGPT." But is this all we need to finally have robots assist humans in everyday tasks? What challenges have been addressed, and which remain unsolved as we look ahead? In this talk, I will discuss recent ways we have integrated Foundation Models into robotic solutions, as well as the limitations of the current FM-based paradigmâ€”particularly in learning from few human demonstrations and in gathering information for complex manipulation tasks.
