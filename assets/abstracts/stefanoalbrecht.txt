Our group specialises in developing machine learning algorithms for autonomous systems control, with a particular focus on deep reinforcement learning and multi-agent reinforcement learning. We have a focus on problems of optimal decision making, prediction, and coordination in multi-agent systems. In this talk, I will give an overview of our research agenda along with some recent published papers in these areas, including our ongoing R&D work with Dematic to develop multi-agent RL solutions for large-scale multi-robot warehouse applications. I will also present some of our research done at UK-based self-driving company Five AI (acquired by Bosch in 2022) on robust and interpretable motion planning and prediction for autonomous driving.
