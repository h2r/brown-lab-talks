Autonomous robots need to decide on actions and follow motions to achieve those actions, yet issues of symbolic planning and motion planning have long been addressed separately.  This talk describes our work on integrated task and motion planning leading to a key challenge, and our novel results, on deciding the existence of motion plans. This line of work offers new capabilities for robots to plan for difficult and complex manipulation scenarios.
