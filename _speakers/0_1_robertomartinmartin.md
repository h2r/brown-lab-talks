Roberto Martin-Martin is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin. His research connects robotics, computer vision, and machine learning. He studies and develops novel AI algorithms that enable robots to perform tasks in human uncontrolled environments such as homes and offices. He creates novel decision-making solutions based on reinforcement learning, imitation learning, planning, and control in that endeavor. He explores topics in robot perception, such as pose estimation and tracking, video prediction, and parsing. Martin-Martin received his Ph.D. from the Berlin Institute of Technology (TUB) before a postdoctoral position at the Stanford Vision and Learning Lab under the supervision of Fei-Fei Li and Silvio Savarese. His work has been selected for the RSS Best Systems Paper Award, RSS Pioneer, ICRA Best Paper Award, Winner of the Amazon Picking Challenge, and has been a finalist for ICRA, RSS, and IROS Best Paper. He is chair of the IEEE Technical Committee in Mobile Manipulation and co-founder of QueerInRobotics.
